# Cut & Bent Bend Detection Algorithm and Image Classification Model

### This repository consists of all the files and materials used in the development of CAB bend Detection and Image Classification Model.

### This model plays a vital role in the CAB order quotation evaluation process, automating the manual process of calculating bends in a variety of shapes requested by the client from a document called the Bar Bending Schedule (BBS), and storing all the bend counts along with the shape they belong to in an excel file.

###  Saving valuable time of the organization and effective resource reallocation.
